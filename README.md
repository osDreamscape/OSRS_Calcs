# OSRS_Calcs

This project provides calculators for Old School RuneScape, such as melee max hit, accuracy, defence, hit chance, and DPS.

To run the project, download the files into a folder, and utilize node.js to run the app.js

In the terminal:
 -> node app.js

 This will run the API back-end on port 3000 on your local system.

 You can then open the index.html with any browser of your choice, and use the calculators included.
 Note: this was primarily tested with Chrome and Firefox on desktop, so your mileage may vary on other systems and browsers.

 Thanks for checking out the project, if you have any questions feel free to contact me!
